# Friendly Chat 

A mobile application coded in the Dart programming language using the Flutter framework. 

## About 

A simple chatting application meant to emulate some of the more famous instant messaging services currently available. Users cannot actually talk to anyone, the functionality is limited to sending and texts and then looking at them. 

The app features animations for the texts, avatar circles, the name of the user, as well as the capability to dynamically assign the theme and color palette of the application depending on the platform the user is on (i.e. android, iOS). Overall, a signficant step in the right direction in my flutter learning journey.
